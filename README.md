# **leaflet-challenge**
The US Geological Survey (USGS) provides scientific data on natural hazards, climate, etc. They aim visualise earthquake data, as they gather extensive global data daily but lack an effective display method. This solution aims to educate the public and government organizations while attracting more funding to address critical planetary challenges.

## **Earthquake Mapper**

This application retrieves earthquake data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) and displays it on a map using Leaflet.js. Each earthquake is represented by a circle marker with a size proportional to its magnitude and a color indicating its depth. The application also includes a legend to help interpret the depth colors.

## **Prerequisites**

Web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## **Installation and Usage**

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. The web page will display a map with earthquake markers and a legend.

## **Features**

- Dynamic map display of earthquake data.
- Circle markers representing earthquakes with size and color indicating magnitude and depth.
- Pop-up information for each earthquake marker.
- Legend indicating the color code for earthquake depths.

## **Libraries and APIs Used**

- Leaflet.js: An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- d3.js: A JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.
- USGS Earthquake API: Provides earthquake data in GeoJSON format.

## **Acknowledgements**

- [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/) for providing the earthquake data.
